NewsTracker is a fullstack web application which allows users to register along with their favourite topics, upon login the app displays the news based on the user’s interest. The news displayed in the app is based on the Newcatcher API and Cricbuzz API from Rapid API site.This project is done for IBM smartinternz on the basis of a course by Anna University.

Performance:
The app works well in both PCs and mobile phones. It takes around 1-2 seconds for the user to login and 5-8 seconds to load the news content. The app didn’t crash upon multiple request and it handled multiple requests effortlessly. We have implemented infinite scrolling mechanism which loads the data whenever the user scrolls the screen , this helps the user to save data and helps the app to load fast.
